## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Boston Airbnb data to better understand:

1. How much revenue the city generated and how was th reviews by the guests.
2. Where are the houses, how it is the ditribuiton in the Boston area.
3. How much revenue each neighbourhood makes and how is their review rating

The project has 3 files:

calendar.csv: A table with the daily payments made to each house. This table also includes the days that the house was empty and not receiving payments.

listings.csv: A table with decriptions of the houses and their hosts.
