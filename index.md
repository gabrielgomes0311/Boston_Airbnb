For a imaginary Airbnb annual meeting i tried to think on 3 questions that company managers interested to know about the Boston market would make:

- How much revenue the city generated and how was the made reviews by the guests.
- Where are the houses, how it is the ditribuiton in the Boston area.
- How much revenue each neighbourhood makes and how is their review rating

## 1. Who we did in this period? (Revenue and review rating)

Airbnb is interested to know not only about revenue and how much the company made that year, but how the guest are feeling about the houses. A low review rating shows that the guests will maybe not come back to Boston or to any Airbnb house. So even with a high annual revenue, if the city has a low review rating this will show that tris operation has a short lifetime ahead.

The total revenue for this period was $ 127 millions with a daily average of $ 350 thousand. In the chart below, we can see that in March had 17% fall on the daily revenue.

This fall of revenue in March was caused by a descresed number of houses being rented and not because had decrease of the daily price. We can see both charts below.

The dialy price did not had the same fall.
